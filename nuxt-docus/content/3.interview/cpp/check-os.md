# check OS with a preprocessor directive

To check the operating system using a preprocessor directive, you can use the `#ifdef` and `#ifndef` directives, along with the appropriate macro for the operating system you want to check for. For example, to check if the operating system is Linux, you can use the following code:

```cpp
#ifdef __linux__
// code for Linux operating system
#endif
```

Similarly, to check if the operating system is Windows, you can use the following code:

```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
// code for Windows operating system
#endif
```

These preprocessor directives check if the specified macro is defined, and if it is, the code inside the `#ifdef` block will be compiled. Otherwise, it will be ignored. You can use this technique to check for any operating system and include the appropriate code for that operating system in your program.

To check if the operating system is macOS, you can use the following code:

```cpp
#ifdef __APPLE__
// code for macOS operating system
#endif
```

This code uses the `__APPLE__` macro, which is defined by the compiler when compiling for macOS. You can use this code to include the appropriate code for macOS in your program.

Note that the `__APPLE__` macro will also be defined when compiling for iOS, so if you want to check specifically for macOS and not iOS, you can use the following code instead:

```cpp
#if defined(__APPLE__) && defined(__MACH__)
// code for macOS operating system
#endif
```

This code checks if both the `__APPLE__` and `__MACH__` macros are defined, which indicates that the program is being compiled for macOS.
