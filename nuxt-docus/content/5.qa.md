if open [analytics], then catch many errors

::details

```
[22:11:33.891] Installing dependencies...
[22:11:34.354]  WARN  Your pnpm-lock.yaml was generated by a newer version of pnpm. It is a compatible version but it might get downgraded to version 5.3
[22:11:34.355] Lockfile is up-to-date, resolution step is skipped
[22:11:34.357]  ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up-to-date with package.json
[22:11:34.357] 
[22:11:34.357] Note that in CI environments this setting is true by default. If you still need to run install in such cases, use "pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile"
[22:11:34.372] Error: Command "pnpm install" exited with 1
```

but when you change install command: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile, then catch

```
[error] Cannot destructure property 'nuxt' of 'this' as it is undefined.
