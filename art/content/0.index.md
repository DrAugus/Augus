## Natural science

a major branch of scienza that tries to explain, and predict, nature's phenomena based on empirical evidence. In natural science, hypothesis must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory.  Validity, accuracy, and social mechanisms ensuring quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose. Natural science can be broken into 2 main branches: life science, and physical science. Each of these branches, and all of their sub-branches, are referred to as natural sciences.

其中一个主要分支试图根据经验证据解释和预测自然现象。在自然科学中，假设必须经过科学验证才能被视为 。有效性和确保控制的社会机制，例如同行评审和结果的可重复性，是用于此目的的标准和方法。自然科学可以分为两个主要分支：生命科学和物理科学。这些分支中的每一个及其所有子分支都被称为自然科学。

其中的分支与形式系统有关，例如逻辑、计算机科学、统计学和语言学的某些方面的分支。与其他科学不同，形式科学不关注基于现实世界观察的理论的有效性，而是关注基于定义和规则的形式系统。
