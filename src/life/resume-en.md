## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Hangzhou Meichuang Technology Co., Ltd

> Software Development Engineer

May 2021 - Aug 2022

- Responsible for the desensitization logic design of all databases, performing custom masking processing for numbers,
  characters, and dates, and performing random desensitization processing for look-up tables for sensitive fields such
  as addresses and names. There is also MongoDB, which recursively performs multi-layer desensitization step by step.
- Designed a Lua engine using LuaJIT, using ELuna and C++ to bind each other. An object for processing data from a SQL
  parser, events provided by C++, performing data access, performing return row control, parsing database schema table
  columns, evaluating desensitization algorithms, and more.
- Optimized the update logic of Lua files, coordinated Java distribution configuration, adopt incremental updates,
  realize parallel loading of Lua engine according to system thread allocation, and greatly reduce update time.

### Liaoning Chuangsheng Network Technology Co., Ltd

> Software Development Engineer

Jul 2018 - Apr 2021

- In the early stage of the project, it is responsible for all interactions between the game and the server and the
  loading and analysis of the basic data of the game itself. Work with the UI layer to jointly improve the client
  interface layout and game dynamics.
- Iteratively updated nearly 30 poker games with local characteristics and different functions. It implements the
  separation of client interface and server logic. All logical functions are implemented on the server, and the client
  is only responsible for requesting, receiving, and forwarding messages, and does not participate in any data
  processing operations. It can well control the data synchronization after players are offline, disconnected, and
  reconnected, and can prevent illegal players from maliciously modifying game data. The independent server logic design
  also facilitates testing for comprehensive unit testing.
- Pay attention to the robustness and scalability of the code, and all the logical functions of the server support the
  realization of multiple decks of poker and multiple cards.
- Responsible for the compilation and maintenance of the company's game environment construction documents, regularly
  reviewed the code of newcomers, and learned and grew together with them.
- During the working period, dozens of new employees have been trained by me. Responsible for familiarizing new
  employees with the server, client logic, and game flow, and guided new employees to familiarize themselves with and
  master Cocos Creator's control usage and script control.
