    "info": "We are all devastated by the news we have just heard from Balmoral.\n\nThe death of Her Majesty The Queen is a huge shock to the nation and to the world.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built.\n\nOur country has grown and flourished under her reign.\n\nBritain is the great country it is today because of her.\n\nShe ascended the throne just after the Second World War.\n\nShe championed the development of the Commonwealth - from a small group of seven countries to a family of 56 nations spanning every continent of the world.\n\nWe are now a modern, thriving, dynamic nation.\n\nThrough thick and thin, Queen Elizabeth II provided us with the stability and the strength that we needed.\n\nShe was the very spirit of Great Britain – and that spirit will endure.\n\nShe has been our longest-ever reigning monarch.\n\nIt is an extraordinary achievement to have presided with such dignity and grace for 70 years.\n\nHer life of service stretched beyond most of our living memories.\n\nIn return, she was loved and admired by the people in the United Kingdom and all around the world.\n\nShe has been a personal inspiration to me and to many Britons. Her devotion to duty is an example to us all.\n\nEarlier this week, at 96, she remained determined to carry out her duties as she appointed me as her 15th Prime Minister.\n\nThroughout her life she has visited more than 100 countries and she has touched the lives of millions around the world.\n\nIn the difficult days ahead, we will come together with our friends…\n\n….across the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the world…\n\n…to celebrate her extraordinary lifetime of service.\n\nIt is a day of great loss, but Queen Elizabeth II leaves a great legacy.\n\nToday the Crown passes - as it is has done for more than a thousand years - to our new monarch, our new head of state:\n\nHis Majesty King Charles III.\n\nWith the King’s family, we mourn the loss of his mother.\n\nAnd as we mourn, we must come together as a people to support him.\n\nTo help him bear the awesome responsibility that he now carries for us all.\n\nWe offer him our loyalty and devotion just as his mother devoted so much to so many for so long.\n\nAnd with the passing of the second Elizabethan age, we usher in a new era in the magnificent history of our great country,\n\n– exactly as Her Majesty would have wished –\n\nby saying the words…\n\nGod save the King.",
